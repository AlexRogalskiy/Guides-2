A Workbook is comprised of one or more Sheets plus any actions you want to take on those Sheets.

## Reference

#### `Blueprint` *object*
Each Workbook has a Blueprint. A <Tooltip tip="Learn more about Blueprint">[Blueprint](docs.com)</Tooltip> is a collection of Sheets that describe a complete dataset.

```jsx  
blueprint: {
  sheets: [
    { fields: [] },
  ]
}
```


#### `Sheets` *array*
A Blueprint contains Sheets. Like tables in a database or sheets in a spreadsheet, Sheets isolate different data schemas.

```jsx  
sheets: [
  {
    name: 'My Sheet 1',
    description: 'This is my Customer Sheet.',
    slug: 'mysheet_1',
    fields: [],
    actions: [],
  },
  {...}
],
```

#### `Fields` *array*
Sheets contain Fields. Fields are defined properties of your schema (eg a first_name on a contact sheet.)

```jsx  
fields: [
  {
    "key": "full_name",
    "type": "string",
    "label": "Full Name",
    "description": "The full name of the customer.",
    "constraints": [
      { "type": "required" }
    ],
    "readonly": true
  },
  {...}
],
```

#### `Actions` *array*
Sheets can also contain Actions. Actions are developer-defined operations or macros invoked by end users on selected data like Submit to API, Download as PDF.

```jsx  
actions: [
  {
    "slug": "download_as_pdf",
    "label": "Download as PDF",
    "type": "string",
    "description": "string",
    "primary": true
  },
  {...}
]
```
