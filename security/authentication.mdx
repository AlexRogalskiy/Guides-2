You can authenticate to Flatfile’s API in two ways: via personal token or secret token. 
The permissions are the same for both; however, the secret token is recommended for programmatic access, i.e. via SDK or scripting.



Flatfile will raise an error if you don’t include a key, or if the key is incorrect or outdated.

Keys will be created for you when you sign up. Use the [Developers Page](https://dashboard.flatfile.com/developers) to reveal or create additional API keys. 


Testing and development
--------------------------

Environments are isolated entities and are intended to be a safe space to create and test different configurations. 
A `dev` Environment is created on default.

| Type            | Name            | Description                              |
| --------------- | --------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Test**          |  `dev` | Use this default environment, and its associated test API keys, as you build with Flatfile.  |
| **Staging**            | `staging` | Create as many environments as you need to mirror your software development life cycle. |
| **Live**            | `prod` | When you're ready to launch, create a new environment and swap out your keys. |


#### Create a new Environment

To create a new Environment via the API:

1. **[Create an access token](https://flatfile.stoplight.io/docs/v10/c867eb7e3c7fe-create-an-access-token)** if you don't have one.
2. [Create an environment](https://flatfile.stoplight.io/docs/v10/452fe93b98b19-create-an-environment).
3. Enter a name in **Name**.
4. Click **Send API Request**.


Secret and publishable keys
---------------------------

All Environments have two key types:

| Type            |  Id            | Description                              |
| --------------- | --------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Secret key**   | `sk_23ghsyuyshs7dcrty` | **On the server-side**: Store this securely in your server-side code. Don’t expose this key in an application. |
| **Publishable key** | `pk_23ghsyuyshs7dcert` | **On the client-side**: Can be publicly-accessible in your application's client-side code. Use when embedding Flatfile. |


#### Create a new API key
