# Introduction

Flatfile is a developer platform for building powerful data collection portals your customers will love.

# Meet the Workbook

A workbook in Flatfile replaces the spreadsheet template you may share with people today when requesting data during the data collection phase of customer onboarding or other business processes. Unlike a spreadsheet, it's designed to allow your team and users to validate, correct, and import data.

![The Flatfile Workbook](Introduction%201610a7a8f62844f5867f031b3d833a07/Frame_27259.png)

The Flatfile Workbook

1. Users can upload data from any of over N supported file types, and you can write your own file extractors if that's not enough.
2. Workbooks apply any validation rules you have defined.
3. Users can add, remove, review, filter, and correct any data imported into a workbook.
4. As a developer, you can define at least one primary action that submits the reviewed data to a destination API, database, or workflow step of your choosing.

In the next 15 minutes, you'll design and configure a workbook for your business. Once you're done you'll be able to embed it in your application as an import flow, or deploy a data collection portal.

# Anatomy of a Workbook

- `Sheets` - like tables in a database or sheets in a spreadsheet, sheets isolate different data schemas.
- `Fields` - Defined properties of your schema (eg a first_name on a contact sheet.)
- `Actions` - Developer defined operations or macros on selected data like Submit to API, Download as PDF
- `Event Hooks` - Whenever any data changes in a workbook, an event is triggered.

# Defining your Schema

Flatfile supports using over 999 different schema DDLs. For this tutorial we're going to create a simple schema using **Blueprint**. But you can also just use your existing schema if you have it by using any of these plugins.

- `@flatfile/plugin-json-schema`
- `@flatfile/plugin-sql-ddl`
- `@flatfile/plugin-openapi`
- `@flatfile/plugin-graphql`

```json blueprint.json
{
  sheets: [
    {
      name: 'Contact',
      fields: [
        { key: 'name', label: 'Full Name' },
        { key: 'email', label: 'Email Address' },
        { key: 'birth_date', label: 'Birth Date', type: 'date' }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

# Let's add a data transformation

Flatfile provides a number of handy plugins for transforming and validating data. We're going to start by using the  `@flatfile/plugin-transform` helper. You can explore the other open source validation plugins available like:

- `@flatfile/plugin-autocast`
- `@flatfile/plugin-pretty-dates`
- `@flatfile/plugin-addresses`

```js transform.js
import { recordHook } from '@flatfile/plugin-transform'

export default function(listener) {
	listener.use(recordHook((record) => {
    // let's simply lowercase this email
		record.transformIfPresent('email', (email) => email.toLowerCase())
	}))
}
```

# Let's add validation

You can use any javascript validation engine in the world to automatically detect formatting or rule-based issues in your data. We'll use the popular `email-validator` package here to make sure the email is actually valid.

```js transform.js
import { recordHook } from '@flatfile/plugin-transform'
import * as EmailValidator from 'email-validator'

export default function(flatfile) {
	listener.use(recordHook((record) => {
    // let's simply lowercase this email
		record.transformIfPresent('email', (email) => email.toLowerCase())
    // apply an error message if invalid
    record.validate('email', 'Email is invalid',  (email) => EmailValidator.validate(email))
	}))
}
```

# Let's configure a submit action

Actions are incredibly powerful. Actions trigger Jobs within the Flatfile ecosystem. You can write your own actions using the `@flatfile/actions` helper library. But we're going to use the webhook action plugin to allow users to submit data from this sheet to your API. There are dozens of other plugins available like:

- `@flatfile/action-download-xlsx`
- `@flatfile/action-download-zip`
- `@flatfile/action-postgresql-egress`

```js transform.js

import { recordHook } from '@flatfile/plugin-transform'
import * as EmailValidator from 'email-validator'
import { webhookAction } from '@flatfile/plugin-webhook-action'

export default function(flatfile) {
	listener.use(recordHook((record) => {
    // let's simply lowercase this email
		record.transformIfPresent('email', (email) => email.toLowerCase())
    // apply an error message if invalid
    record.validate('email', 'Email is invalid',  (email) => EmailValidator.validate(email))
	}))

  // this will setup a primary action for your workbook
	flatfile.use(webhookAction({
		name: 'Submit Data',
		type: 'primary',
		format: 'key-value',
		url: '[https://webhook.site](https://webhook.site/)'
	}))
}
```

# Next Steps

You now have a configured workbook. Next you should learn about a few more concepts.

**Spaces**

Control access to data and build powerful, multi-workbook workflows.

**Embedding**

If you want to embed an import button or dialog in another application.

**Advanced**

Dynamic configurations, identifying users, user permissions, automation, performance tips.
