Actions are incredibly powerful. 
Actions trigger Jobs within the Flatfile ecosystem. 
You can write your own actions using the `@flatfile/actions` helper library. 
But we're going to use the webhook action plugin to allow users to submit data from this sheet to your API. 

There are dozens of other plugins available like:

- `@flatfile/action-download-xlsx`
- `@flatfile/action-download-zip`
- `@flatfile/action-postgresql-egress`

```jsx
import { recordHook } from '@flatfile/plugin-transform'
import * as EmailValidator from 'email-validator'
import { webhookAction } from '@flatfile/plugin-webhook-action'

export default function(flatfile) {

  // this will setup a primary action for your workbook
	listener.use(webhookAction({
		name: 'Submit Data',
		type: 'primary',
		format: 'key-value',
		url: '[https://webhook.site](https://webhook.site/)'
	}))
}
```

### Next Steps
You now have a configured workbook. Next you should learn about a few more concepts.
