title: 3. Configure a submit action
description: "Learn how to create a simple submit action in Flatfile."

Actions are incredibly powerful buttons added to the UI that [when clicked by end users] trigger <Tooltip tip="Learn about Jobs">[Jobs](../concepts/jobs)</Tooltip> 
that run within the Flatfile ecosystem. 

### Using Action Plugins

For this tutorial, we're going to perform a simple submit action without using a plugin.

There are dozens of open-source action plugins available like: 

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card color="#CB3837" title="@flatfile/plugin-action-download-xlsx" icon="npm" href="npmjs.com">
  </Card>
  <Card color="#CB3837" title="@flatfile/plugin-action-download-zip" icon="npm" href="npmjs.com">
  </Card>
  <Card color="#CB3837" title="@flatfile/plugin-action-postgresql-egress" icon="npm" href="npmjs.com">
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Adding your first action 

In this example, we're going to add an action to the primary action `submitAction` you see in the workbook you already deployed. 
This action will take data from the sheet and submit it to TODO:webhook.site.

<a target="_blank" class="group px-4 py-1.5 relative inline-flex items-center rounded-full shadow-sm text-sm font-medium" 
href="https://replit.com/@flatfile/get-started#index.ts">
    <span class="absolute inset-0 bg-primary-dark rounded-full group-hover:opacity-[0.9]"></span>
    <span class="z-10 mr-2 text-white">See it in Replit</span>
    <svg width="6" height="3" class="h-2 overflow-visible -rotate-90 text-white" aria-hidden="true"><path d="M0 0L3 3L6 0" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="1.5" stroke-linecap="round"></path></svg>
</a>


```jsx
async function submitAction(event: any, sheetName: string, data: any) {
  //submit to webhook.site
}
```

## Recap & Next Steps
Congratulations! You now have a configured workbook with transformations, validations, and a final submit action. 
This completes the Quickstart tutorial.

Next, you should [deploy your code](../developer-tools/deploying) to your Environment or 
learn more about the [Concepts](../concepts/spaces) to take this example further.
