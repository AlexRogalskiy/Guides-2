title: 2. Transform & validate data
description: "Respond to events in Flatfile and transform data."
---

Whenever any data changes in a Workbook, an event is triggered via <Tooltip tip="Learn more about Events">Event Hooks</Tooltip>. 
Using our powerful [@flatfile/listener](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@flatfile/listener) library, we will intervene the `record` event and perform callback functions
based on the values provided inside that event.

<Tip>
  Flatfile provides a number of handy plugins for transforming and validating data. Explore open source validation plugins available like 
  [@flatfile/plugin-autocast](hello.com), [@flatfile/plugin-pretty-dates](hello.com), [@flatfile/plugin-addresses](hello.com).
</Tip>

## Start listening for events
Begin capturing Events as they happen in your Workbook with this [dev sandbox](https://replit.com/@AshleyMulligan/BogusFinancialAssembler#index.ts). 

<Info>You'll need to add your [secret key](../security/authentication) to the `.flatfilerc` file to get authenticated.</Info>

#### How it works: 

Every time this polling driver gets a new event from your Workbook, you will be able to see 
the UI respond by updating the data in your Sheet.


<a target="_blank" class="group px-4 py-1.5 relative inline-flex items-center rounded-full shadow-sm text-sm font-medium"

    <span class="absolute inset-0 bg-primary-dark rounded-full group-hover:opacity-[0.9]"></span>
    <span class="z-10 mr-2 text-white">See it in Replit</span>
    <svg width="6" height="3" class="h-2 overflow-visible -rotate-90 text-white" aria-hidden="true"><path d="M0 0L3 3L6 0" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="1.5" stroke-linecap="round"></path></svg>
</a>


## Add your first data transformation
In this example, we will transform the data provided inside the record event using the `record.transform` helper from the [@flatfile/plugin-record-hook](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@flatfile/plugin-record-hook) plugin.

```jsx
client.use(recordHook('my-sheet1', (record: FlatfileRecord) => {
	record.transform('full_name', () => `${first_name} ${last_name}`)
	return record;
}));
```

## Add your first validation

You can use any javascript validation engine in the world to automatically detect formatting or rule-based issues in your data. We'll use the popular [email-validator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/email-validator) package here to make sure the email is actually valid.

```jsx
client.use(recordHook('my-sheet1', (record: FlatfileRecord) => {
	record.transform('full_name', () => `${first_name} ${last_name}`)
	record.validate('email', 'Email is invalid',  (email) => EmailValidator.validate(email))
	return record;
}));
```

### Next Steps
Next, we will add an action that submits data from this Sheet to your API.
