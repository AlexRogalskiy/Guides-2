title: 2. Transform & validate data

<Info>If you haven't seen your new workbook yet, head over to your [Dashboard](https://dashboard.flatfile.com) and check it out before continuing.</Info>

As you were interacting with your new workbook in Flatfile, you may have made added or edited the records in it. 
Whenever any data changes in a workbook, an event is triggered in Flatfile via <Tooltip tip="Learn more about Events">[Event Hooks](../concepts/events)</Tooltip>. 

Using our powerful [@flatfile/listener](../core-libraries/listener) core library, we can listen for every event and then decide how we want to respond.
With records specifically, often this looks like transforming and validating the data.

### Using transformation & validation plugins

For this tutorial, we will perform a simple data transformation by updating records in our Sheet using the core [@flatfile/hooks](../core-libraries/hooks) library.

Flatfile provides a number of handy [transformation & validation plugins](https://plugins.flatfile.com) to reshape the data before it gets updated. Explore open source validation plugins available like:

  </Card>
  <Card color="#CB3837" title="@flatfile/plugin-pretty-dates" icon="npm" href="https://plugins.flatfile.com">

## Using the `record` event

For this example, we will intervene the `record` event topic with a powerful plugin, [@flatfile/plugin-record-hook](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@flatfile/plugin-record-hook) and perform callback functions
based on the values provided inside that event.

### How it works: 

Every time this polling driver gets a new event from someone interacting in your workbook, you will be able to 
respond by updating the data in your sheet. The UI will immediately reflect those changes.


1. To get started, begin capturing Events as they happen in your Workbook with this [dev sandbox](https://replit.com/@AshleyMulligan/BogusFinancialAssembler#index.ts) in Replit. 
2. To run this sandbox, type `npm run flatfile develop â€”key=<publishableKey>` in your terminal.

## Adding your first data transformation

In this example, we will transform the data provided inside the record event using the `record.transform` helper 
from the [@flatfile/plugin-record-hooks](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@flatfile/plugin-record-hooks) plugin.

This transformation specifically will take full name and split it into first and last name.

```jsx
client.use(recordHook('my-sheet1', (record: FlatfileRecord) => {
	record.transform('full_name', () => `${first_name} ${last_name}`)
	return record;
}));
```

## Adding your first validation

In this example, we will validate the data provided inside the record event using the `record.validate` helper 
also from the [@flatfile/plugin-record-hooks](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@flatfile/plugin-record-hooks) plugin.

This validation specifically will use the popular [email-validator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/email-validator) package 
to make sure the email is actually valid.

<Tip>
You can use any javascript validation engine in the world to automatically detect formatting or rule-based issues 
in your data.
</Tip>


```jsx
client.use(recordHook('my-sheet1', (record: FlatfileRecord) => {
	record.transform('full_name', () => `${first_name} ${last_name}`)
	record.validate('email', 'Email is invalid',  (email) => EmailValidator.validate(email))
	return record;
}));
```

## Recap & Next Steps

You should now have a locally running listener that is responding to record changes in your Workbook.

Next, we will add an action that submits data from this Sheet to your API.
