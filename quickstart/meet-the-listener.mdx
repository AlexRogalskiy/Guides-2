A workbook in Flatfile replaces the spreadsheet template you may share 
with people today when requesting data during the data collection phase 
of customer onboarding or other business processes. Unlike a spreadsheet, 
it's designed to allow your team and users to validate, correct, and import data.


In the next 15 minutes, you’ll design and configure a workbook 
for your business. Once you’re finished you’ll be able to embed it in your application 
as an import flow, or deploy a data collection portal.



<a target="#hello" class="group px-4 py-1.5 relative inline-flex items-center rounded-full shadow-sm text-sm font-medium" 
href="#hello">
    <span class="absolute inset-0 bg-primary-dark rounded-full group-hover:opacity-[0.9]"></span>
    <span class="z-10 mr-2 text-white">Download full app</span>
    <svg width="6" height="3" class="h-2 overflow-visible -rotate-90 text-white" aria-hidden="true"><path d="M0 0L3 3L6 0" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="1.5" stroke-linecap="round"></path></svg>

### Using Workbooks

The Workbook brings together automation and humans to get data into its final shape. 
With Workbooks, you can:

1. Accept data from any of over N supported file types. (And you can write your own file extractors if that's not enough.)
2. Automatically apply any validation rules a developer has previously defined.
3. Provide end users the ability to add, remove, review, filter, and correct any data imported into a Workbook.
4. Define [in code] at least one primary action that submits the reviewed data to a destination API, database, or workflow step of your choosing.

### Designing a Workbook

#### The anatomy of a Workbook

- `Sheets` - like tables in a database or sheets in a spreadsheet, sheets isolate different data schemas.
- `Fields` - Defined properties of your schema (eg a first_name on a contact sheet.)
- `Actions` - Developer defined operations or macros on selected data like Submit to API, Download as PDF
- `Event Hooks` - Whenever any data changes in a workbook, an event is triggered.

#### Define your Schema

Flatfile supports using over 999 different schema DDLs. For this tutorial we're going to create a simple schema using **Blueprint**. But you can also just use your existing schema if you have it by using any of these plugins.

- `@flatfile/plugin-json-schema`
- `@flatfile/plugin-sql-ddl`
- `@flatfile/plugin-openapi`
- `@flatfile/plugin-graphql`


```jsx  workbooks.create
import { Flatfile, FlatfileClient } from '@flatfile/api-beta';

void main();

//create a new client
async function main() {
  const flatfile = new FlatfileClient({
    publishableKey: 'pk_1234567',
  });

const createWorkbook = await flatfile.workbooks.create(spaceId, {
  sheets: [{
    name: 'Contact',
    fields: [
      { key: 'name', label: 'Full Name' },
      { key: 'email', label: 'Email Address' },
      { key: 'birth_date', label: 'Birth Date', type: 'date' }
    ]
  }]
})

```
