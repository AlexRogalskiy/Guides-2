Flatfile's API is an event-driven, etc etc. The Flatfile **PubSub Client** is a super thin wrapper around the Flatfile API. 
It allows you to call our API after receiving events from any PubSub driver. 

### Using Events

Once an event is received, it is routed to any awaiting listeners which are added with `addEventListener()` or its alias `on()`.


#### The anatomy of an Event

Flatfile events follow a standard structure and event listeners can use any of the following syntaxes to react to events within Flatfile.

- `context` - something
- `target` - something

#### Usage

Using our powerful [@flatfile/listener](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@flatfile/listener) library we can intervene between any event and run a callback function based on values provided inside that event.

### Next Steps
Up next, use the [@flatfile/plugin-recordhooks](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@flatfile/plugin) to listen for a `records:updated` event and respond with a change.
