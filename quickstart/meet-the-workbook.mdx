A workbook in Flatfile replaces the spreadsheet template you may share 
with people today when requesting data during the data collection phase 
of customer onboarding or other business processes. Unlike a spreadsheet, 
it's designed to allow your team and users to validate, correct, and import data.


In the next 15 minutes, you’ll design and configure a workbook 
for your business. Once you’re finished you’ll be able to embed it in your application 
as an import flow, or deploy a data collection portal.

## Using Workbooks

The Workbook brings together automation and humans to get data into its final shape.

With Workbooks, you can:
1. Accept data from any of over N supported file types. (And you can write your own file extractors if that's not enough.)
2. Automatically apply any validation rules a developer has previously defined.
3. Provide end users the ability to add, remove, review, filter, and correct any data imported into a Workbook.
4. Define [in code] at least one primary action that submits the reviewed data to a destination API, database, or workflow step of your choosing.


## Building your first Workbook

Flatfile supports using many different schema DDLs. You can also just use your existing schema if you have it by using plugins like 
  `@flatfile/plugin-json-schema`, `@flatfile/plugin-sql-ddl`, `@flatfile/plugin-openapi`, `@flatfile/plugin-graphql`.
  
  For this tutorial, we're going to create a simple schema using <Tooltip tip="Learn more about Blueprint">**Blueprint**</Tooltip>.
