A workbook in Flatfile replaces the spreadsheet template you may share 
with people today when requesting data during the data collection phase 
of customer onboarding or other business processes. Unlike a spreadsheet, 
it's designed to allow your team and users to validate, correct, and import data.


In the next 15 minutes, you’ll design and configure a workbook 
for your business. Once you’re finished you’ll be able to embed it in your application 
as an import flow, or deploy a data collection portal.

### Using Workbooks

The Workbook brings together automation and humans to get data into its final shape. 
With Workbooks, you can:

1. Accept data from any of over N supported file types. (And you can write your own file extractors if that's not enough.)
2. Automatically apply any validation rules a developer has previously defined.
3. Provide end users the ability to add, remove, review, filter, and correct any data imported into a Workbook.
4. Define [in code] at least one primary action that submits the reviewed data to a destination API, database, or workflow step of your choosing.

### Designing a Workbook

#### The anatomy of a Workbook

- `Sheets` - like tables in a database or sheets in a spreadsheet, sheets isolate different data schemas.
- `Fields` - Defined properties of your schema (eg a first_name on a contact sheet.)
- `Actions` - Developer defined operations or macros on selected data like Submit to API, Download as PDF
- `Event Hooks` - Whenever any data changes in a workbook, an event is triggered.

#### Define your Schema

Flatfile supports using over 999 different schema DDLs. For this tutorial we're going to create a simple schema using **Blueprint**. But you can also just use your existing schema if you have it by using any of these plugins.

- `@flatfile/plugin-json-schema`
- `@flatfile/plugin-sql-ddl`
- `@flatfile/plugin-openapi`
- `@flatfile/plugin-graphql`

### Create a Workbook

```jsx  workbooks.create
import { FlatfileClient } from '@flatfile/api';

void main();

async function main() {
  const flatfile = new FlatfileClient({
    publishableKey: '1234', //find this at dashboard.flatfile.com
  });

  // Create a Workbook
  const createWorkbook = await flatfile.workbooks.create({
    name: 'My Workbook 1',
    //define your schema
    blueprint: {
      sheets: [
        {
          name: 'My Sheet 1',
          description: 'hello',
          slug: 'slug1',
          fields: [
            {
              key: 'firstName',
              type: 'string',
              label: 'First Name',
              description: 'The first name of the customer',
              constraints: [
                {
                  type: 'required',
                },
              ],
            },
            {
              key: 'lastName',
              type: 'string',
              label: 'Last Name',
              description: 'The last name of the customer',
              constraints: [
                {
                  type: 'required',
                },
              ],
            },
            {
              key: 'fullName',
              type: 'string',
              label: 'Full Name',
              description: 'The full name of the customer',
            },
          ],
        },
      ],
    }
  });
}
```
