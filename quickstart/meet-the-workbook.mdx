description: "Learn how to create your first Workbook in Flatfile."

A workbook in Flatfile replaces the spreadsheet template you may share 
with people today when requesting data during the data collection phase 
of customer onboarding or other business processes. Unlike a spreadsheet, 
it's designed to allow your team and users to validate, correct, and import data.


In the next 15 minutes, you’ll design and configure a workbook 
for your business. Once you’re finished you’ll be able to embed it in your application 
as an import flow, or deploy a data collection portal.



<a target="#hello" class="group px-4 py-1.5 relative inline-flex items-center rounded-full shadow-sm text-sm font-medium" 
href="#hello">
    <span class="absolute inset-0 bg-primary-dark rounded-full group-hover:opacity-[0.9]"></span>
    <span class="z-10 mr-2 text-white">Download full app</span>
    <svg width="6" height="3" class="h-2 overflow-visible -rotate-90 text-white" aria-hidden="true"><path d="M0 0L3 3L6 0" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="1.5" stroke-linecap="round"></path></svg>
</a>

## Using Workbooks

The Workbook brings together automation and humans to get data into its final shape.

With Workbooks, you can:
1. Accept data from any of over N supported file types. (And you can write your own file extractors if that's not enough.)
2. Automatically apply any validation rules a developer has previously defined.
3. Provide end users the ability to add, remove, review, filter, and correct any data imported into a Workbook.
4. Define [in code] at least one primary action that submits the reviewed data to a destination API, database, or workflow step of your choosing.


## Building your first Workbook

Flatfile supports using many different schema DDLs. For this tutorial, we're going to create a 
simple schema using <Tooltip tip="Learn more about Blueprint">**Blueprint**</Tooltip>.

<Info>
  You can also just use your existing schema if you have it by using plugins like 
  `@flatfile/plugin-json-schema`, `@flatfile/plugin-sql-ddl`, `@flatfile/plugin-openapi`, `@flatfile/plugin-graphql` .
</Info>

*Postman will be embedded here to call the API and create a Workbook.**

### Next Steps
Next, we'll add data transformations and validations to your newly created Workbook.
