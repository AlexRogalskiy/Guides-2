description: "Learn how to create your first Workbook in Flatfile."

A workbook in Flatfile replaces the spreadsheet template you may share 
with people today when requesting data during the data collection phase 
of customer onboarding or other business processes. Unlike a spreadsheet, 
it's designed to allow your team and users to validate, correct, and import data.


In the next 15 minutes, you’ll design and configure a workbook 
for your business. Once you’re finished you’ll be able to embed it in your application 
as an import flow, or deploy a data collection portal.

### Using Workbooks

The Workbook brings together automation and humans to get data into its final shape. 

<img src="../images/quickstart/workbook.png" caption="The Flatfile Workbook"/>

With Workbooks, you can:
1. Accept data from any of over N supported file types. (And you can write your own file extractors if that's not enough.)
2. Automatically apply any validation rules a developer has previously defined.
3. Provide end users the ability to add, remove, review, filter, and correct any data imported into a Workbook.
4. Define [in code] at least one primary action that submits the reviewed data to a destination API, database, or workflow step of your choosing.


### Using Schemas

For this tutorial, we're going to create a simple schema using <Tooltip tip="Learn more about Blueprint">[Blueprint](../blueprint/overview)</Tooltip>. 

Flatfile supports using many different schema DDLs. If you have an existing schema, you can choose from many different open-source [schema plugins](https://plugins.flatfile.com) like:

<CardGroup cols={4}>
  <Card color="#CB3837" title="@flatfile/plugin-json-schema" icon="npm" href="npmjs.com">
  </Card>
  <Card color="#CB3837" title="@flatfile/plugin-sql-ddl" icon="npm" href="npmjs.com">
  </Card>
  <Card color="#CB3837" title="@flatfile/plugin-openapi" icon="npm" href="npmjs.com">
  </Card>
  <Card color="#CB3837" title="@flatfile/plugin-graphql" icon="npm" href="npmjs.com">
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Recap & Next Steps
You should now have a Workbook in your Account. Head over to your [Dashboard](https://dashboard.flatfile.com) to see it and interact with it. 

Next, we'll bring your Workbook to life by adding data transformations and validations to it.
