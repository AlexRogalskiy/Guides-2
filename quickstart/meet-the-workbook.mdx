A workbook in Flatfile replaces the spreadsheet template you may share 
with people today when requesting data during the data collection phase 
of customer onboarding or other business processes. Unlike a spreadsheet, 
it's designed to allow your team and users to validate, correct, and import data.


In the next 15 minutes, you’ll design and configure a workbook 
for your business. Once you’re finished you’ll be able to embed it in your application 
as an import flow, or deploy a data collection portal.



<a target="#hello" class="group px-4 py-1.5 relative inline-flex items-center rounded-full shadow-sm text-sm font-medium" 
href="#hello">
    <span class="absolute inset-0 bg-primary-dark rounded-full group-hover:opacity-[0.9]"></span>
    <span class="z-10 mr-2 text-white">Download full app</span>
    <svg width="6" height="3" class="h-2 overflow-visible -rotate-90 text-white" aria-hidden="true"><path d="M0 0L3 3L6 0" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="1.5" stroke-linecap="round"></path></svg>
</a>

#### Using Workbooks

The Workbook brings together automation and humans to get data into its final shape. 

<img src="..//images/quickstart/workbook.png" caption="The Flatfile Workbook"/>

With Workbooks, you can:
1. Accept data from any of over N supported file types. (And you can write your own file extractors if that's not enough.)
2. Automatically apply any validation rules a developer has previously defined.
3. Provide end users the ability to add, remove, review, filter, and correct any data imported into a Workbook.
4. Define [in code] at least one primary action that submits the reviewed data to a destination API, database, or workflow step of your choosing.

### The anatomy of a Workbook

#### `Blueprint` *object*
Each Workbook has a Blueprint. A <Tooltip tip="Learn more about Blueprint">[Blueprint](docs.com)</Tooltip> is a collection of Sheets that describe a complete dataset.

```jsx  
blueprint: {
  sheets: [
    { fields: [] },
  ]
}
```


#### `Sheets` *array*
A Blueprint contains Sheets. Like tables in a database or sheets in a spreadsheet, Sheets isolate different data schemas.

```jsx  
sheets: [
  {
    name: 'My Sheet 1',
    description: 'This is my Customer Sheet.',
    slug: 'mysheet_1',
    fields: [],
    actions: [],
  },
  {...}
],
```

#### `Fields` *array*
Sheets contain Fields. Fields are defined properties of your schema (eg a first_name on a contact sheet.)

```jsx  
fields: [
  {
    "key": "full_name",
    "type": "string",
    "label": "Full Name",
    "description": "The full name of the customer.",
    "constraints": [
      { "type": "required" }
    ],
    "readonly": true
  },
  {...}
],
```

#### `Actions` *array*
Sheets can also contain Actions. Actions are developer-defined operations or macros invoked by end users on selected data like Submit to API, Download as PDF.

```jsx  
actions: [
  {
    "slug": "download_as_pdf",
    "label": "Download as PDF",
    "type": "string",
    "description": "string",
    "primary": true
  },
  {...}
]
```
### Define your schema and build a Workbook

Flatfile supports using many different schema DDLs. For this tutorial, we're going to create a 
simple schema using <Tooltip tip="Learn more about Blueprint">**Blueprint**</Tooltip>.

Next, we'll wrap your Blueprint in a Workbook and <Tooltip tip="Learn more about authentication">authenticate your client</Tooltip>. 

<Info>
  You can also just use your existing schema if you have it by using plugins like 
  `@flatfile/plugin-json-schema`, `@flatfile/plugin-sql-ddl`, `@flatfile/plugin-openapi`, `@flatfile/plugin-graphql` .
</Info>

```jsx 
import { FlatfileClient } from '@flatfile/api';

void main();

async function main() {
  const flatfile = new FlatfileClient({
    publishableKey: '1234', //find this at dashboard.flatfile.com
  });

  const blueprint = {
      sheets: [
        {
          name: 'My Sheet 1',
          description: 'hello',
          slug: 'slug1',
          fields: [
            {
              key: 'firstName',
              type: 'string',
              label: 'First Name',
              description: 'The first name of the customer',
              constraints: [
                { type: 'required' },
              ],
            },
            {
              key: 'lastName',
              type: 'string',
              label: 'Last Name',
              description: 'The last name of the customer',
              constraints: [
                { type: 'required' },
              ],
            },
            {
              key: 'fullName',
              type: 'string',
              label: 'Full Name',
              description: 'The full name of the customer',
            },
          ],
        },
      ],
    }

  // Create a Workbook
  const createWorkbook = await flatfile.workbooks.create({
    name: 'My Workbook 1',
    //define your schema
    blueprint: blueprint
  });
}
```
